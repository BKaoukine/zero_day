
# Vagrant

This directory contains a Vagrantfile and a shell script that installs various dependencies for developing and testing software in a virtual environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this Vagrantfile, you need to install the following software on your host machine:

-   [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
-   [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

## Usage

To start the virtual machine, navigate to this directory in your terminal and run the following command:


    `vagrant up` 

This will create and provision a new virtual machine according to the configuration specified in the Vagrantfile.

To access the virtual machine, run the following command:


    `vagrant ssh` 

This will open a new terminal session inside the virtual machine, where you can run commands and access files as if you were on a remote server.

To stop and destroy the virtual machine, run the following command:


    `vagrant destroy` 

This will remove all files and resources associated with the virtual machine.
